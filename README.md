Project 3


main.py development documentation:
- Group met for 2+ hours to create coding for the main.py, Fernando shared screen and we made our Classes work together.

Score Class development documentation:
- First struggles: creating the skeleton for the class, and finding a way to print scoreboard on the turtle screen even though I am not the one generating the turtle screen.
- I was able to create a basic score class. Will improve class according to the group needs.

Food Class development documentation:
- Created a Food class with attributes that the user can input in -> changed so that the programmers set the attributes (no user input)
- Color and shape of food is randomized for each play
- Default position exists -> position is randomly changed after the food is eaten by the snake
- Can track the location of the food with a method in class
- Added a method where the food can be hidden
